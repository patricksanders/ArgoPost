# ArgoPost #

## Description ##
ArgoPost is a website for students and faculty to post and view html text
posts, organized into forums and threads.  The postings will have an expiration
date, after which the post will no longer be shown in the viewer.  Postings
will be searchable by text string and sortable by topic.  Users can subscribe
to a thread and receive an email when new posts are added.  The supported
browsers will be the last two versions of IE, Chrome, Safari and Firefox.
Posting and viewing will require authentication using ArgoNet login.  A post
can only be edited by the owner of the post.  Faculty will have the ability to
delete posts and alter the structure of ArgoPost.
